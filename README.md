# NodeAddition
Automated Node Addition: Automates addition of a new node/list of new nodes with help of CM API to cluster. This eliminates the manual steps using UI to add the node. Once the prechecks are validated, user can triger the script to add the node to the cluster.


Steps to run: 

Note: This scripts should be used after the following host prechecks are configured and one is ready to add the new host to cluster
  ###Prerequisite Checks : 
 ```
 OS Validations: Ensure following OS level validations
    -vm.swappiness=1
    -Firewall (ip tables) is disabled
    -SE Linux is disabled
    -Transparent Huge Pages are disabled
    -IPv6 is disabled
    -NTPD is synchronized and running
    -Forward and Reverse DNS Lookup is enabled
    -Disk Check
```
```
  Security checks
    -Kereberos Checks: 
      Validate openldap-clients and krb5workstation, krb5-libs are installed
      A copy of krb5.conf is copied to the new node to /etc/krb5.conf
      Correct version of jdk and jce are installed.
   -TLS [Assuming TLS is already enabled for Cloudera Manager Server and Agents (CM TLS level 3)
     Node should have valid certificates : The Server certificates, java keystore, CA certs should be placed in the correct
     locations.(mostly /opt/cloudera/security/<ca-certs/pki/jks/x509> )
 ```
 ```
 1. After the prechecks, configure the config section parameters in node_addition.sh
    JAVA_HOME="/usr/java/latest"
    host=`hostname`
    VERSION="5.11"
    CM_SERVER=""
    CM_USERNAME=""
    CM_PASSWORD=""
    CLUSTER=""
    SCRIPT_PATH="/path to python cm_new_host_addition.py script/"
    CERTS_PATH="/opt/cloudera/security/pki"
  ```
  ```
 2. $> ./node_addition.sh
 ```
